## **Project Overview**
FarmPulse is a smart agriculture platform that provides real-time monitoring, predictive analytics, and actionable insights to farmers. It empowers them to:
- Detect diseases and pests early  
- Optimize irrigation and fertilizer usage  
- Track crop growth and productivity  
- Reduce losses and improve sustainability  

---

## **Key Features**
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Daily crop monitoring, resource usage, disease alerts, and productivity metrics.  
- **AI-Powered Disease Detection**: Supervised ML to classify plants (Healthy / Diseased) and provide actionable recommendations.  
- **Farmer & Field Segmentation**: Unsupervised ML clusters farmers by performance, crop type, and field characteristics.  
- **Business Intelligence Reports**: Interactive charts, KPIs, and PDF reports for decision-making.  
- **Cross-Platform Mobile App**: Flutter app for Android & iOS with smooth navigation and responsive design.  
- **Real-Time Notifications**: Alerts for irrigation, disease risk, and crop management actions.  

---

## **AI & ML Integration**
- **Supervised Learning**:  
  - Disease detection from crop images  
  - Predicting crop yield based on historical data, weather, and soil conditions  

- **Unsupervised Learning**:  
  - Farmer segmentation by crop type, performance, and behavior  
  - Detection of unusual patterns in field productivity  

- **Integration**: All AI insights are sent to the BI dashboard for actionable recommendations.  

---

## **Business Intelligence (BI)**
- **Descriptive Analytics**: Track field performance, water usage, fertilizer application, and crop health.  
- **Predictive Analytics**: Forecast crop yield, disease outbreaks, and resource needs.  
- **Diagnostic Analytics**: Identify causes of low productivity or high disease incidence.  
- **Decision Support**: Provide farmers with real-time guidance for irrigation, fertilization, and harvesting.  

---

## **User Interface**
- **Dashboard Main Page**: Overview of crops, alerts, productivity metrics  
- **Operations Tracking**: Record planting, watering, and harvesting activities  
- **Disease & Pest Detection**: View affected plants and AI recommendations  
- **Analytics & Reports**: Charts, graphs, and performance summaries  
- **Farmer Segmentation**: Performance clusters and improvement suggestions  
- **Resource & Sustainability Management**: Track water, fertilizer, and recycled waste usage  
- **Settings & Help**: User preferences, field management, and tutorials
